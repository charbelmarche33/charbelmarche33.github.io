1)	What was the project assignment? 

This project was done so that we can use the techniques we learned about adverserial searches in our AI class. We used several techniques such as alpha-beta pruning and implemented the min max algorithm. We essentially needed to make a chess program that played against the both the professors chess program and a random agent, that could consistently beat both.

A rubric for this assignment is here:
http://cs.umw.edu/~stephen/cpsc415/program3.html

2)	What did you learn from the project? 

This assignment taught me to really appreciate how difficult it is to create artificially intelligent programs and how much processing power and time it takes for a program like this to run. It also really tested my will power to keep working on the chess program and try to improve it. It was definitely one of my hardest assignments at UMW.

3)	What would you do differently next time? 

Next time, I would try to use multithreading to see if I can have my program go a few plies deeper then it does already.

4)	Link your artifact for the project.

This is the github link to the source code:

https://github.com/charbelmarche33/ArtificialIntelligenceChess

To run the chess program run this command in the terminal:

```
    ./main_chess.py
```

For some systems you may need to run:

```
    python3 main_chess.py
```
