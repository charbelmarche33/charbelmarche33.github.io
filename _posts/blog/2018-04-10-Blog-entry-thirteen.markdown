1)	What was the project assignment? 
    
    The test plan was a test plan for the weather web application. The implementation team and I needed to make a test plan document to give to the testing team so that they can test our project. This paper was a part of my Software engineering class.  

2)	What did you learn from the project? 
    
    Working on this paper taught me the difference between the different types of tests and helped me practice writing technical papers.
    
3)	What would you do differently next time? 
    
    If I could redo this paper I would definitely make sure that my team and I started earlier, because creating this document took us longer than we expected.
    
4)	Link your artifact for the project.
    
    This is the github link to the docx file, you just need to download it to your machine to view it:
