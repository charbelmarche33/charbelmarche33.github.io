1)	What was the project assignment? 

The Zelda GBA game project was for my Computer Systems and Architechture class. We needed to create a GBA game in C. I got to work on this assignment with a partner, my suitemate. These were the only requirements.

Must have:
1) A scrolling, tiled background.
2) At least two different sprites.
3) Two functions in your game written in assembly code. Each must actually be called in the game and each must be at least eight lines of code.

A link to the full assingment prompt is here:

2)	What did you learn from the project? 

I learned a lot about C and making games for the GBA from this project. I also learned that I really enjoy making games, because once your work is done you get to kick back and play what you made.

3)	What would you do differently next time? 

I would probably have started earlier on this assignment because this assignment was gruesome. 

4)	Link your artifact for the project.

This is the github link to the source code:

To run this game, download a GBA emulator from here:

Then drag the program.gba file onto the emulator. It's fun. Play it. Seriously.
