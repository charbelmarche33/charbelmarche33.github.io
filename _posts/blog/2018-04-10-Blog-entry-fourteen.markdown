1)	What was the project assignment? 
    
    The usability study was an assignment for my Software Engineering class where I needed to take a certain function of the application and survey a group of people on how they would expect that functionality to work. The function I chose to do my usability study on was the search feature, where the user searches by a location and a date. I asked the people I spoke with how they expected the search fields to work.  

2)	What did you learn from the project? 
    
    I learned from doing this that many people who are not comfortable with technology need clear instructions on how to use application, because they are nearly as familiar as I am with it. I needed to avoid making assumptions that users would understand can be done.
    
3)	What would you do differently next time? 
    
    If I could redo this paper I would not do much differently. I would probably try and avoid giving suggestions of what they could potentially expect for the location field to see what each person I interviewed comes up with on their own.
    
4)	Link your artifact for the project.
