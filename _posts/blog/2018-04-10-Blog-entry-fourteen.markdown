1)	What was the project assignment? 

The usability study was an assignment for my Software Engineering class where I needed to take a certain function of the application and survey a group of people on how they would expect that functionality to work. The function I chose to do my usability study on was the search feature, where the user searches by a location and a date. 

2)	What did you learn from the project? 

I learned from working on this project that many people who are not comfortable with technology need clear instructions on how to use an application. They are necessarily as familiar with technology as I am. I needed to avoid making assumptions that users would understand can be done without instruction.

3)	What would you do differently next time? 

If I could redo this paper I would not do much differently. I would probably try and avoid giving suggestions of what they could potentially expect for the location field to see what each person I interviewed comes up with on their own.

4)	Link your artifact for the project.

This is the github link to the docx file, you just need to download it to your machine to view it:
