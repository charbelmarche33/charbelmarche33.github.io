1)	What was the project assignment? 

The weather web application was made to be a web application that displays historical weather averages for different cities in the United States on different days of the year. This app uses data from DarkSky's free API. The project was done for a professor at the University of Mary Washington as a final project in our Software Engineeering class. 

These were the requirements for this project (from the client):

1  The system must allow the user to search for the average weather data for a given location on a specific day, going back at least 2-5 years, but preferably up to 50 years back.
2  The system should have a drop down calendar to allow the user to choose the date, with the current date being highlighted in one color, and the chosen date being highlighted in another color.
3  The system should accept a location in the form of a zip code, city or state.
4  The location and date fields should have default text prompting the user to enter the appropriate information.
5  The system should provide instructional prompts for the user on how to enter information.
6  The system must have a submit button that should only show results if there are valid inputs for date and/or location.
7  If there are not valid inputs for date and/or location upon submitting the search, the system must tell the user what (date and/or location) they entered that was not valid.
8  The system must show the percent of days it has precipitated on the chosen day, no matter how close or far, as well as the average temperature for that day.
9  If the date selected is with in 10 days of the current date, the forecast for the weather at that location must also be shown.
10  The system should have a bar graph showing the average temperature for each half decade that the system has information about at the given location.
11  The system should have a pie graph displaying the historical odds of different types of weather (sunshine, clouds, snow, rain) at the given location.
12  The system should allow users to register, log in, and log out.
13  The system should remember past searches for registered users.

2)	What did you learn from the project? 

This project taught me a lot about working with groups and the intracicies of the software process in general. It taught me the benefits of working at the same location and time and also taught me tons about Flask and web applications.

3)	What would you do differently next time? 

If I could do this project again from the start, I would try and work at the same place and at the same time as my group members. This would have saved us a lot of time and prevented a plethora of integration bugs.

4)	Link your artifact for the project.
